1) Xth AL_score contains the score and index of the reactions in Xth AL iteration.
2) 004.morph phase mapping_nonstd: the dataset [containing reaction parameters and reaction outcomes (multiclasses)] collected after 4th AL runs (not standardized)
3) 005.morph phase mapping: the dataset [containing reaction parameters and reaction outcomes (multiclasses)] collected after 5th AL runs (standardized)
4) 005.morph phase mapping_3vs4: the dataset [containing reaction parameters and reaction outcomes (3 vs 4)] collected after 5th AL runs (standardized)
5) 005.morph phase mapping_nonstd: the dataset [containing reaction parameters and reaction outcomes (multiclasses)] collected after 5th AL runs (not standardized)
for 006.morph phase mapping series, see explanation for 005. (dataset 006 include the 24 KS sampling reactions)

6) 006.morph phase mapping_nonstd: the dataset [containing reaction parameters and reaction outcomes (multiclasses)] collected after 5th AL runs and one KS sampling (not standardized)

crystal scores: different from the manuscript, in this python code, clear solution is 1, red phase is 3, and yellow phase is 4.
